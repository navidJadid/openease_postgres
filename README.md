openease/postgres
================

Repository which contains the postgres database code for the openease project.

Cannot be run by itself as of right now. Either build the [whole project](https://github.com/ease-crc/openease) with docker-compose (will pull the most recent docker-build from [`docker-hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/openease/postgres)) or check out the [development project](https://github.com/navidJadid/openease_webserver_development).
